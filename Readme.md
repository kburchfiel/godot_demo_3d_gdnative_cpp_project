# Basic GDNative C++ 3D Godot Project

I created this project in order to learn how to create 3D Godot projects using GDNative and C++. At the moment, the project is very simple: it merely shows how to move a cube across a surface using your arrow keys. However, I hope to expand on the project as time allows so that the project can become an actual game.
