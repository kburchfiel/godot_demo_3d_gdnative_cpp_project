# Basic GDNative C++ 3D Godot Project

I started this project in order to learn how to create 3D Godot projects using GDNative and C++. At the moment, the project is very simple: it merely shows how to move a cube across a surface using your arrow keys. However, I hope to expand on the project as time allows so that the project can become an actual game.

## Resources:

The following resources proved very helpful in creating this project:


## Instructions:

This project is based on the 3.5 release of Godot. Therefore, it uses GDNative rather than GDExtension. Once Godot 4 has a stable release, I'll plan to create a similar project using GDExtension.
